# ft_printf - @42Wolfsburg

Exam to recreate the base of the printf function.

## About

ft_printf is the project in the first ring at 42.
We practice using loops, if conditions, flag identification. Variadic functions are introduced in this project.
The main goal is to structure code meaningfully and start thinking Libft functions can be used in subsequent projects.

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
The only requirements are:
- GNU make (v3.81)
- GCC (12.0.0) (clang-1200.0.32.28)

Those versions are the ones used during development.

### Building the program

1. Download/Clone this repo

        git clone https://github.com/qduong42/42_ft_printf
2. `cd` into the root directory and run `make`

        cd 42_ft_printf
        make

### Running the program

After running make, the libftprintf.a library with printf and Libft functions can be used.

## Main Project Instructions

### Mandatory

- Only use C
- Must respect the 42 imposed coding style The Norminator
- No memory leaks
- Implement ft_printf
- Must have a Makefile to build the program
- The library must be called libft.a
- Must have a header file libft.h

### Allowed Functions

- malloc, free, write,
va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end
    
## Notes

I tried to make the solution as simple and intuitive as possible. I saw some 'overengineered' solutions

Enjoy!
